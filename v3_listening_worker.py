"""

Listens for task messages on the queue.
This process runs continously. 

Make as many listening workers as you need 
(start this process in multiple terminals).

Approach
---------
Work Queues - one task producer / many workers sharing work.


Terminal Reminders
------------------

- Use Control c to close a terminal and end a process.

- Use the up arrow to get the last command executed.
